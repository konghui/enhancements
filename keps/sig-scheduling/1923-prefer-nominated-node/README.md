## Summary

This KEP proposes to change the scheduling cycle such that nominated node of a pod is evaluated first
and schedule the pod on that node if it fits. If the nominated node doesn't fit the pod, only then the
scheduling cycle continues with the standard logic of evaluating the rest of the nodes in the cluster.

## Motivation

If the scheduler fails to fit an incoming pod on any node, it will try to preempt lower priority pods
running on a selected node to make room for the pod. The name of this node will be set in the
pod's `.status.nominatedNodeName`.

The Node is called *Nominated* to indicate the intent for the Pod to be scheduled on it once preemption
of other Pods finishes. However, the Pod's `.status.nominatedNodeName` information is not fully utilized
in the Pod's following scheduling attempts.

Pod scheduling is split into two phases, the scheduling cycle and the binding cycle, the scheduling cycle
primarily includes filtering and scoring.

When preemption happens in a previous scheduling cycle, there is a high chance that the nominated node is
the *only* node that satisfies the filters for the unscheduled Pod that triggered preemption.

In real production environment, pods can have different priorites due to business needs, the preemption
could happen to make sure higher priority pods could get scheduled.

In cluster with large number of computing nodes, evaluating all nodes when scheduling a pod is time consuming.

### Goals

Prefer scheduling a pod to its `.status.nominatedNodeName` if set, if the nominated node doesn't fit the pod,
the scheduling cycle will continue to evaluate the rest of the nodes in the cluster just like we do today.


## Proposal

### User Stories (Optional)

Users want faster scheduling. Since it is highly likely the pod will only fit on the nominated node, the improvement
in scheduling latency will come at negligible cost (the cost being placing the pod on a less optimal node).

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

When this feature is enabled the preemptor Pod might not be dispatched to the best candidated node in some corner case,
e.g. another node releases the resources and becomes the best candidate while the victim pods got removed from the
nominated node.

## Design Details

### Implementation Details

1. In filtering phase, which is currently implemented in the method of `findNodesThatFitPod`, check the nominated node
   first if the incoming pod has the `.status.nominatedNodeName` defined and the feature gate is enabled.

2. In case the nominated node doesn't suit for the incoming pod anymore, get `err` from `findNodesThatPassFilters` where
   `NominatedNode` is firstly evaluated, the `err` will be padded with more information to tell that scheduler is evaluating
   the feasibility of `NominatedNode` and failed on that node.

   If no error is returned but `NominatedNode` cannot pass all the filtering, this is possibly caused by the resource that
   claims to be removed but has not been fully released yet.

   For both of above cases, scheduler will continue to evaluate the rest of nodes to check if there is any node already
   available for the coming pod.

### Test Plan

Following tests will be covered or considered:

- **Unit Tests**: All core changes must be covered by unit tests.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration test will be provided if necessary, for example,
  - enable the feature
  - preempt the victim pods on the nominated node
  - check pod will be scheduled on the nominated node
- **Benchmark Tests**: A benchmark test which compares the performance before and after the change.
  The performance improvement is visible by benchmark of `scheduler_framework_extension_point_duration_seconds{extension_point="Filter"}` in a large cluster
  where preemption is expected to happen frequently.


### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. The KEP
should keep this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to
determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

#### Alpha

- New feature gate proposed to enable the feature.
- Implementation of the new feature in scheduling framework.
- Test cases mentioned in the [Test Plan](#test-plan).

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys.
- The feature is guarded by a feature flag, and will be enabled by default in beta.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

_This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release._

* **How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?**
  - [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
    - Feature gate name: PreferNominatedNode
    - Components depending on the feature gate: kube-scheduler

* **Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?**
  Yes. If the coming pod has the nominated node set, then the nominated node will be evaluated first in any
  scheduling cycle, this is only the default process logic that is handled by scheduler, end-user will not
  and need not aware of any difference.

* **Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back
  the enablement)?**
  Yes. It can be disabled by restarting scheduler with feature gate turned off.

* **What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?**
  The feature will start working again when scheduling pods.

* **Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?**
  unittest will switch the feature gate manually to enable the feature, and compare the different behavior.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?**
  The rollout can always fail (e.g. if there is a bug and scheduler will start crashlooping on certain conditions).
  It's a scheduler features, so it doesn't affect already running workloads.

* **What specific metrics should inform a rollback?**
  Noticeable and sustainable increase in `scheduler_framework_extension_point_duration_seconds{extension_point="Filter"}`
  latency metric.

* **Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?**
  Manually tested successfully.

* **Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs,
fields of API types, flags, etc.?**
  No.

### Monitoring Requirements

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?**
  N/A

* **What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine
the health of the service?**
  - [x] Metrics
    - Metric name: `scheduler_framework_extension_point_duration_seconds{extension_point="Filter"}`
    - Components exposing the metric: kube-scheduler
  - [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
    - Details:

* **What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?**
  - 99% of filter latency for the pod scheduling is within x seconds.


* **Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability
of this feature?**
  No.

### Dependencies

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?**
  No.

### Scalability

_For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them._

_For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions._

_For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field._

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?**
  Describe them, providing:
  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?**
  Describe them, providing:
  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud
provider?**
  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of
the existing API objects?**
  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any
operations covered by [existing SLIs/SLOs]?**
  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of
resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?**
  No.

### Troubleshooting

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?**
  No impact since the pod is already in the internal Queue.

* **What are other known failure modes?**
  N/A

* **What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?**
  N/A
