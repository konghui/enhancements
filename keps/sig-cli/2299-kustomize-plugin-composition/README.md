## Summary

Introduces a new Kustomize API (`kind`) that is oriented around Kustomize plugins, making them a first-class expression of a resource configuration bundle.

This new API will provide new sophisticated capabilities for using plugins as composable
units and include support for automatic discovery and installation of plugins.  It will showcase
plugins as a way to implement composable, declarative client-side abstractions.

## Motivation

The `Kustomization` API was designed around built-in Kustomize transformer and generator
operations applied to Kustomize bases. This API is suboptimal for workflows that
are primarily composed of Kustomize plugins.  Challenges with the current approach include:

1. Packaging, distribution and installation of plugins is immature and non-declarative.
2. `Kustomization` separates plugins into three categories: generators, transformers and validators. With abstraction-based plugins, which mechanism the plugin uses is opaque to the end user and may even change based on input. This leads all abstraction-based plugins to be placed under `transformers`. Because these are executed after built-in transformers, an additional `Kustomization` layer is typically required to use built-ins fruitfully in abstraction-based workflows.
3. Although it is possible to transform plugin configuration as resources before execution, it is not possible to have a sensible distribution of concerns in configuration sets composed this way. Notably, plugin configuration must be finalized (e.g. tailored to an environment) before it can be combined with built-in configuration at all, and built-in transformers cannot be specified in bases, or else they will not apply to the results of the plugins.

### Goals

Develop an API (`kind`) for Kustomize that is focused on plugin-based workflows.

A successful implementation of this API should have the following characteristics:

1. The orchestration model used to evaluate the API must be simplified in a way that is optimized for plugins. Notably, it must be easy to recursively compose and modify lists of plugins in a way that yields an overall configuration structure that reflects the user's intent.
1. Plugin orchestration must be central to the new API format. Support for existing Kustomize operations should be compiled in, but expressed in the same way as extensions plugin operations.
1. The machinery for the new API must enable seamless invocation of sets of approved
plugins, and must not require out-of-band imperative installation steps.
1. The new API must cleanly integrate with the existing Kustomize tool (i.e. `kustomize build`).

### Non-Goals

- Replace Kustomize as "the way" to do anything.
- Expand the scope of the existing `Kustomization` API.
- Directly integrate with `kubectl apply`, `kubectl diff`, etc. The new API will
 be compatible with those and other tools via evaluation into a resource list
 suitable for use in gitops workflows.
- Pull resources or files from a remote git source.

## Proposal

Introduce `Composition` as a new API `kind` recognized by `kustomize build`. A `Composition` must be defined in a `composition.yaml` file, and inclusion of both `composition.yaml` and `kustomization.yaml` in the target directory of a build will be considered an error.

The Composition API enables users to:

- Define a list of Kubernetes-style configuration objects called **modules**.
A module is a client-side resource that expresses the desired state implemented by
a Kustomize plugin.
- Import modules from another Composition and add them to the list.
- Override an imported module's fields with new values.
- Reorder the list of modules prior to execution.

Once a user has written a Composition, all they need to do is run `kustomize build`
to turn it into a list of Kubernetes resources that they can commit to git.

To provide this experience, Kustomize will need to do the following during builds:

- Consolidate the Composition and its imports into a finalized list of modules.
- Automatically fetch and execute the plugin that implements each module.
- Pass the output of each plugin invocation as the input to the next plugin.

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

As a user, I can define my configuration as a sequence of declarative abstractions
implemented by plugins that are automatically discovered and installed.

```yaml
# app/composition.yaml
kind: Composition

modules:
# generate resources for a Java application
- apiVersion: example.com/v1
  kind: JavaApplication
  provider: {container: {image: example/module_providers/java:v1.0.0}}
  metadata:
    name: my-app
  spec:
    application: team/my-app
    version: v1.0
# transform resources to inject a logger
- apiVersion: example.com/v1
  kind: Logger
  provider: {container: {image: example/module_providers/logger:v1.0.3}}
  metadata:
    name: logger
```

#### Story 2

As a user, I can reuse and extend an existing Composition by importing its modules and
optionally overriding imported modules' fields.

```yaml
# staging/composition.yaml
kind: Composition

modulesFrom:
# import the JavaApplication and Logger modules
- path: ../app/composition.yaml
  importMode: prepend

moduleOverrides:
# override the JavaApplication version before the function is run
- apiVersion: example.com/v1
  kind: JavaApplication
  metadata:
    name: my-app
  spec:
    version: v1.1-beta

modules:
# transform resources from imported modules to inject metrics
- apiVersion: example.com/v1
  kind: Prometheus
  provider: {container: {image: example/module_providers/prometheus:v1.0.2}}
  metadata:
    name: metrics
  spec:
    prefix: my-app-
```

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

#### Integration with Kustomization

For the alpha phase, the integration between Composition and Kustomization should be unidirectional: Composition can process a Kustomization via a built-in transformer, but Composition cannot be loaded from a Kustomization.

For the beta phase, we should consider enabling Kustomizations to reference Compositions in the `resources` and various plugin fields. When used in `resources` or `generators`, the Composition would be executed with empty input and the results would be added to the resource list. When used in `validators` or `transformers`, the resource list would be provided as input to the first module in the consolidated Composition, and in the case of `transformers`, the output would replace the resource list.

Regardless of Kustomization integration, all extensions plugin execution from either Kind should remain gated behind `--enable-alpha-plugins`. This means Composition will essentially be useless in `kubectl -k` for the time being, since plugins cannot be enabled in that context. If the evolution of plugins leads to enablement in kubectl becoming acceptable in the future, plugins defined in both Kinds should be enabled the same way.

### Risks and Mitigations

#### Security of running containers locally

Composition has similar capabilities to Kustomization.

The key difference for security is that it does not require plugins to be installed in advance / out of band. This difference is
key to the user experience, and it does decrease user awareness of exactly what is
being executed. As such, it must be made clear to users that Compositions are not inherently
secure and that they should only build Compositions they trust.

This risk will be mitigated in the following ways:

1. Container-based functions will be run without network or volume access. This does
limit the functionality they can implement, but it also encourages plugins
to be developed such that the module resources that configure them express
the entire desired state. Should this prove unacceptably limiting, network or volume access
may be introduced in a future version, but likely with a more explicit and restrictive
permissions model than plugins have today. The same is true for exec plugins: they
will not be initially supported, and additional restrictions will likely be placed on them
if support is introduced in the future.

1. Even if network or volume access support is added, containers will still run
without it unless the user's Composition explicitly grants it. If exec support
is added, a checksum may be required in addition to the binary location.

1. Plugins will not be trusted by default. The execution framework will feature
a pluggable trust model that enables users and organizations to allowlist plugin
sources. It should be possible for large organizations to distribute binaries with
specific allowlists compiled in, and for additional sources to be allowlisted at
invocation time.

## Design Details

### Key terminology

This terminology is not set in stone at this early stage, but should be
used consistently within this proposal.

  * **Composition**: a new plugin-oriented API (`kind`) to be understood by `kustomize build`.
  * **module**: a client-side resource that expresses the desired state implemented by
a Kustomize plugin. Modules are analogous to server-side custom resource instances.
      * **Built-in module**: a module whose implementation is provided by Kustomize itself.
      * **Extensions module**: a module whose implementation is provided by a plugin.
  * **plugin/function**: a Starlark or container function that complies with
the existing [Configuration Functions Specification](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/cmd/config/docs/api-conventions/functions-spec.md). Functions are analogous to server-side controllers.
Although they power the new API, functions are not the center of the user experience, the same way
controller code is not the focus of (or even referred to in) server-side resource expressions.
  * **module definition**: an OpenAPIv3 schema describing a module. Analogous
  to a server-side CRD.

### API schema

Example showing all fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Composition

# `modulesFrom` imports module lists from other Compositions.
# The target Compositions' own imports, overrides and reorderings are applied before it is imported.
modulesFrom:
- path: ../app/composition.yaml
  importMode: prepend # this is the default; append is also possible

# `moduleOverrides` allows fields of modules imported via `modulesFrom` to be changed before execution.
# Entries are treated as strategic merge patches.
moduleOverrides:
- apiVersion: example.com/v1
  kind: JavaApplication
  metadata:
    name: my-app
  spec:
    application: team/my-app
    version: v3.1.3

# `modules` adds new modules to the list.
modules:
- apiVersion: example.com/v1
  kind: Prometheus
  provider:
    container:
      image: example/prometheus:v1.0.2
  metadata:
    name: metrics-injector

# `moduleOrder` allows advanced users to reorder the merged modules list explicitly.
# modules can be referred to by name alone as long as names are unique.
moduleOrder:
  - name: my-app
  - name: logger
  - name: metrics
```

### Built-in modules

The Composition implementation itself should provide a select few modules that
implement essential functionality, notably functionality that is available through
Kustomization built-ins today.

Essential starter set:

1. `kind: StaticResources`: a way to load custom-written Kubernetes resources from the
filesystem for processing. Equivalent to the `resources` field in Kustomization, but
not capable of fetching from remote sources.
1. `kind: Kustomize`: support basic transformations via fields such as `spec.commonLabels`,
as well as processing a Kustomization.yaml referred to by path.

The following example shows how this core Kustomize functionality would be expressed
as modules that fit in elegantly alongside plugin-driven modules:

```yaml
...
modules:
- metadata:
    name: local-resources
  kind: StaticResources
  apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
  spec:
    paths:
    - ../resources
- metadata:
    name: prod-customizations
  kind: Kustomize
  apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
  spec:
    commonLabels:
      env: production
    namespace: my-app-prod
```

Other possibilities include:

- A validation module.
- Exposing individual Kustomization built-in transformers in Composition as well. The built-in HelmChartInflationGenerator would be particularly well-suited for this, since it provides module-like encapsulated functionality.

### Function invocation

To work with Composition, functions need to comply with the existing [Configuration Functions Specification](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/cmd/config/docs/api-conventions/functions-spec.md).

Function invocation machinery will be built using the existing `sigs.k8s.io/kustomize/kyaml/fn/runtime` package.
It will work largely the same way function invocation does in Kustomization, with
the following notable exceptions:
* The function to be invoked will be specified in a new reserved field called `provider`
rather than being embedded in module metadata.
* The `provider` field will only support the `container.image` and `starlark.path` options,
at least at first.
* Composition will _always_ use the `ResourceList` input format when
invoking functions, and will _always_ include the `functionConfig` field.
That field will contain the module.

### Composition evaluation

Composition topologically sorts imported modules with its own modules
and then runs the combined list sequentially. This means that arbitrary depths of
imports always result in a single consolidated Composition prior to execution.

For use cases that require resources to be evaluated eagerly before further processing,
for example diamond-shaped configuration, the built-in `StaticResources` module can be given
a Composition to render into resources.

### Function packaging and distribution

The canonical way to build functionality for Composition will be to publish
functions as container images that are semantically versioned using tags,
and to include the image registry in Composition's allowlist. The format of
that list is TBD, but ideally it can be provided at compile time for organizational
use as well as at runtime.

Function authors will be encouraged to label their containers with module definitions.
Doing so will unlock additional functionality, such as making the `provider` field
optional in cases where a module's APIVersion+Kind resolve uniquely within the registry.

Ad hoc functions can be written in Starlark and stored locally with the
Composition. If remote Starlark functions are supported in the future,
a similar "registry" model will be needed for them.

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

* The new API provides another way to run plugins, and may be confusing to users
trying to decide which to use. Creating separate APIs for Deployment, StatefulSet,
DaemonSet have similar drawbacks.

* Since this new API is oriented entirely around plugins, it will likely lead to
workflows in which a considerable number of plugins must be invoked to render
the resource list. Especially for container plugins, this may not be performant.
Although the same issue would exist in today's plugins via Kustomization,
it may become more apparent if plugins get a substantial increase
in ease of use.

## Alternatives

* Implement these capabilities in the `Kustomization` API. All of the fields proposed
in the new API could instead be added as top-level fields, or grouped fields, in
`Kustomization`. However, the result would not be very elegant. In particular,
one of the primary proposed features--enabling module configuration to be overridden--requires
a completely different evaluation model. Namely, a topological sort is applied to the
entire tree of modules prior to evaluation, as opposed to Kustomization's current
model of executing generators, transformers and plugins in each level in isolation.
Combining these two mental models within a single API would be difficult and likely
lead to considerable confusion among users.
* Implement this as an independent tool. This is certainly a possibility, but
this proposal is effectively an improved way of exposing existing Kustomize features.
As such, it would be great if the Kustomize community could leverage it directly.
