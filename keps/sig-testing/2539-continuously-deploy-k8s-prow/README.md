## Summary

This document proposes to change deployment of k8s prow from manual to be automated continuously.

## Motivation

Currently, deploying k8s prow consists of following steps:

1. Updates made in prow are released as container images.
1. Automated process creates PRs updating the prow images tags.
1. Oncall inspects prow logs to make sure prow is safe to upgrade.
1. Oncall inspects PRs created in step #2, approve them, and post message on Slack.
1. Oncall waits until #4 and a postsubmit job applying the changes on prow cluster.
1. Oncall waits until #5 is done, do several manual inspections to make sure prow works.

This is a very time consuming process (Roughly 3 hours per week for oncall), especially the context switching between the waits makes oncall hard to focus on their day job. Thus it’s desired to streamline the process so that we can save time.

Historically, the biggest reasons why the manual processes were introduced are:

- Errors in prow were not easily discoverable, most of time were reported by prow users, which was bad.

This problem has been largely solved by the introduction of prow monitoring + alerting by grafana, prometheus, and prometheus alertmanager stack. And based on our experience in the past quarter, we haven’t had a single case where prow errors were discovered by humans earlier than by prow alerts. This fact gives us reasonable confidence to proceed with continuous delivery, and the following assumptions should hold:

- Prow is stable as long as there is no alert. (Indicate that no need to inspect prow logs before bumping)
- Errors caused by prow upgrades are discovered by prow alerts in a timely manner.


### Goals

The proposed change switches from daily manual deployment to hourly automated deployment.

#### Prow Users

Shouldn’t see any change, prow breakage should be discovered by prow monitoring system and rollback will be performed. The chance of prow being break is almost identical to what we have today(Assume there are not more than a single breaking change every day).

#### Prow Oncall

- What’s Not Changed
  - React to prow alerts and take actions.
- What’s Changed
  - Decouple prow logs inspection from prow bump.
  - No more manual lgtm/approve/retest autobump PRs.
  - No more manual Slack posting.


### Non-Goals

Change how prow is released.


## Proposal

Prow autobump PRs are automatically merged every 3 hours, only on working hours of working days.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

#### Breaking Changes in Prow
Breaking changes in prow will require manual intervention. Currently prow isn’t able to handle these intelligently, as it was not designed with the mindset of API versions and thus kubernetes conversion webhook can not help coping with breaking changes among major APIs.
One possible way of dealing with breaking changes, is:
- Prow oncall inspects prow logs and breaking changes announcements once per week, and take actions based on deprecation warnings from prow logs and breaking changes from ANNOUNCEMENTS.md.
- [Stretch Goal][Push left] Discover breaking changes, especially configs or flag changes in prow integration test (This requires prow integration test use the same set of deployment configs as prod)
- [Optional] (This is not very reliable) Prow TLs inspects new PRs, manually identifies possible breaking changes and informs oncall for awareness. Either prow TL or oncall can take deeper look at the new PR and decide whether to take actions or  not.

## Design Details

#### Automated Merging of Prow Autobump PRs

- Prow autobump job is already configured to run on work days only, change it to at least one hour apart, so that it doesn’t bump more frequently than one hour.
- Tide blindly trusts PRs from the bot that does autobump, merging the PR as long as tests all pass. Flaky tests will be covered by auto-pushing of new autobump jobs later.

This approach uses tide auto-merge feature, so that no need to worry about repo requirements such as need more than one approver etc.

#### Roll Back Process

When prow stopped functioning after a bump, prow oncall should:
- Stop auto-deploying by commenting `/hold` on latest autobump PR.
- Manually create rollback PR for rolling back to known good version.
  - Prow is not super actively developed currently, normally there are not many
    changes between bumps, and it should be easy to identify culprit.
  - General rule of thumb is we can assume last bump was good.
- Manually apply the changes from rollback PR by running [`prow/bump.sh`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/deploy.sh)

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha -> Beta Graduation

- Low frequency continuous deployment bumped prow as expected
- Known prow failures are captured by alerts ahead of non-oncall human

#### Beta -> GA Graduation

- High frequency continuous deployment bumped prow as expected
- Testgrid displays prow plank version

#### Announcement

Before enabling Alpha phase, this will be announced:
- On #prow and #testing-ops channel on Slack
- Via email to the entire kubernetes-dev@googlegroups.com group

## Implementation History


## Alternatives

#### A new tool merges autobump PRs

Instead of letting tide merge PR, an alternative idea is to created a dedicated
continuous deploy job that takes full control:
- Merge autobump PR on a fixed schedule

##### Pros:
- This method is independent of tide, which makes sure it works on every prow instance.

##### Cons:
- The tools is pretty similar to tide, means there will be lots of duplicated
  logic with tide.

The biggest pros of this approach, is that it works better with prow instance
that doesn't have tide support yet, for example prow that works with gerrit.
However, there are two reasons for not going this path:
- The current design is targeting k8s prow, which does have tide.
- Tide will eventually come to gerrit and this can be evaluated later which
  should be done first: tide for gerrit, or continuous deploy prow with gerrit.
