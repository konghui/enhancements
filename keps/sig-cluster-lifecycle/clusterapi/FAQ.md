# Cluster API CAEPs

Cluster API follows its [own process](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/contributing#proposal-process-caep) for enhancement proposals.
The current list of proposals can be found [here](https://sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/docs/proposals).

**Note:** CAEP process is fundamentally a derivative of the KEP.
